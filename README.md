## Computational Genomics:

Purpose of this page is to show that I can implement common bioinformatics tools to conduct in-depth analysis of metagenomic samples and that I can create scripts that can emmulate some of the most common tools that are used in bioinformatics today. 

### Burrow-Wheeler_Transform, Suffix arrays and Recursive Binary Search

To create a script that performs a Burrow wheeler transform and suffix array on FASTA file. This is to demonstrate knowledge of algorithms that use these techniques for searching for genes. The suffix array is then used as the data structure for the binary search algorithim, which is done recursively, to look for local gene inside FASTA file. 

### FastQ score Quality

Used Biopython to create a script to determine the read quality of my fastq file and plotted the quality scores using matplotlib

### Genetic Drift with Inbreeding

Calculated and created a visual representation of what happens to the homozyogosity of the population when inbreeding is present. 

### Metagenomic Analysis of Mouse Gut Microbiome

I wrote a report on how to do taxonomic classification on unknown metagenomes, showing skills using common bioinformatic tools to make these classifications. To do this I used two unknown metagenomes that were sampled from the mouse gut environment and performed different metagenomic analysis to see if it will be possible to determine the composition of these metagenomes based on the assembly of the shotgun DNA sequences. PDF of the report is also uploaded here on github.
